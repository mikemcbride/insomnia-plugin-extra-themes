## Contributing

I wanted to make this plugin flexible so that others could contribute their own themes more easily, and also have a frame of reference for how to do it. If you would like to add your own theme, you can use one of the files in the `themes` folder as a template and customize the colors.

To do that, I'd suggest you fork and clone this repo, and move the cloned folder (or symlink it) to your local Insomnia plugins folder. You can find that by opening Insomnia and navigating to `Preferences > Plugins`, then clicking "Show Plugins Folder" at the bottom. As you develop you will likely need to quit and re-open Insomnia for changes to take effect.

Once you've got it working, feel free to cut a PR here! Screenshots are always appreciated in PRs.
